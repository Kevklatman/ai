# Machine Learning Journey: PGA Tour Prediction Project 🏌️‍♂️🤖

## Project Goal
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a PGA Tour player will finish in the top 10 of a tournament. This project serves as an introduction to machine learning concepts using real-world sports data.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic machine learning workflow
- Learn data preprocessing techniques
- Implement a classification model
- Evaluate model performance
- Interpret results and improve the model

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preparation
1. **Initial Data Analysis** (`initial_set/`)
   - Load and examine the PGA Tour dataset
   - Understand available features
   - Identify missing values
   - Visualize basic statistics
   
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create target variable (top 10 finish)
   - Select relevant features
   - Handle missing values
   - Create derived features (e.g., recent performance metrics)

### Phase 2: Basic Model Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Scale features
   - Handle categorical variables
   
2. **First Model: Logistic Regression**
   - Implement simple logistic regression
   - Train the model
   - Make predictions
   - Evaluate basic performance

### Phase 3: Model Evaluation and Improvement
1. **Performance Analysis**
